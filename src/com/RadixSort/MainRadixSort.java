// ------------RADIX SORT----------

/*this is also a assumption algo
 * data must have the same radix and width
 * now what is radix :????
 * example say decimal has a radix of 10 there can be 10 diff digits in the decimal system
 * and the radix of the binary is 2 as there can be only 0 or 1
 * radix of alphabets is 26 as there can  be 26 diff alphabets
 * 
 * now what is width:????
 * the number of digits or charaters in a data or a string 
 * example hello has a width of 5 as there are 5 characters in the hello letter
 * 1489 has a width of 4 as there are 4 digits
 * 10 has a width of 2
 * 
 * the radix sort start at the right most position
 * 
 * example of an array that can be sort by the radix sort is 1542,7937,9083,2390,7645,9546 
 * now the above array has a width of 4 and they all have the same radix and width 
 * 
 * ************* the radix sort should be a stable sorting algo this is the critical condition for this algo to work
  in the above example say 1542,7937,9083,2390,7654,9546 :
  we first sort the array on the basis of the digits at ones place so we get
  2390,1542,9083,7654,9546,7937 this is the array if we sort them according to the one places
  then we again sort the above array with regard to the ten's place digits and we go on
 *
 *therefore we get to know that to make this algo work this had to be stable else this algo wont work
 *
 *the radix sort can be slower than the O(nlogn) algo as there is significant overhead in this type of algo
 *
 *we can use the stable couting sort to implement the radix sort algo
 the counting sort we used in the previous was not stable
